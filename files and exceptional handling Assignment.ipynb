    "Q1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages ? \n",
    "ANS: Compiled Languages\n",
    "     Definition: Translated entirely into machine code before execution using a compiler.\n",
    "     Execution: Fast, because the code is already compiled into a format the machine can directly execute.\n",
    "     Examples: C, C++, Rust, Go, Swift\n",
    "     \n",
    "   Interpreted Languages\n",
    "     Definition: Executed line-by-line at runtime using an interpreter.\n",
    "     Execution: Slower than compiled code since it’s being translated on the fly.\n",
    "     Examples: Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2.  What is exception handling in Python? \n",
    "ANS: Exception handling in Python is a mechanism that allows you to deal with errors or unexpected situations in a controlled way, so your program            doesn’t crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling? \n",
    "ANS: The finally block in Python is always executed, no matter what—whether an exception is raised, handled, or not raised at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is logging in Python?\n",
    "ANS: Logging in Python is the process of recording events or messages during the execution of a program. It’s an essential tool for debugging,              monitoring, and tracking the behavior of your application—especially in production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python? \n",
    "ANS: The __del__() method is a special method in Python known as a destructor. It's called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed—           typically when it goes out of scope or the program ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6.  What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python? \n",
    "ANS: Both import and from ... import are used to bring external modules or specific components into your Python program — but they behave differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
    "ANS: In Python, you can handle multiple exceptions using:\n",
    "     Multiple except blocks\n",
    "     Single except block with a tuple\n",
    "     Generic except block (use with care)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8.  What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python? \n",
    "ANS: The with statement in Python is used to automatically manage resources—especially useful when working with files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
    "ANS:  Multithreading\n",
    "      Definition: Running multiple threads (lightweight processes) within a single process.\n",
    "      Used for: I/O-bound tasks (e.g., file I/O, network requests)\n",
    "      Threads share the same memory space.\n",
    "      Multiprocessing\n",
    "      Definition: Running multiple processes, each with its own memory space and Python interpreter.\n",
    "      Used for: CPU-bound tasks (e.g., image processing, computation-heavy tasks)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10.  What are the advantages of using logging in a program? \n",
    "ANS: Logging is a powerful tool that provides insight into your program’s execution. It’s far more flexible and professional than using print()             statements. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. What is memory management in Python ? \n",
    "ANS: Memory management in Python refers to the process of allocating, managing, and freeing memory used by Python objects during a program's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python ? \n",
    "ANS: Exception handling in Python allows your program to deal gracefully with runtime errors without crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13. Why is memory management important in Python ? \n",
    "ANS: Memory management is crucial because it ensures your Python programs run efficiently, reliably, and without crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling ?\n",
    "ANS: The try block contains the code that might raise an exception during execution.\n",
    "     Python runs the code inside the try block and monitors for errors.\n",
    "     If no exception occurs, the code runs normally and Python skips the except blocks.\n",
    "     If an exception occurs, Python immediately stops executing the try block and jumps to the matching except block.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q15. How does Python's garbage collection system work? \n",
    "ANS: Python’s garbage collection (GC) system is designed to automatically manage memory by reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer in      use, helping prevent memory leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling ? \n",
    "ANS : The else block in Python's exception handling is an optional block that runs only if no exceptions were raised in the preceding try block.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q17. What are the common logging levels in Python? \n",
    "ANS: Python’s built-in logging module defines several standard logging levels to categorize the importance and severity of log messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python? \n",
    "ANS: Use os.fork() if you need direct access to OS-level process creation and are on Unix/Linux.\n",
    "     Use multiprocessing for most Python programs needing concurrency with easier syntax and cross-platform compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
    "ANS: When writing to a file, Python uses a buffer to temporarily hold data. Closing the file flushes the buffer, ensuring all data is actually written      and saved to the disk. If you don’t close the file, some data may remain unwritten, causing data loss or corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
    "ANS: Use read() to get the entire file content at once.\n",
    "     Use readline() to process the file one line at a time, especially useful for large files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q21. What is the logging module in Python used for ?\n",
    "ANS. The logging module in Python is a built-in library designed to provide a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs. It         allows developers to track events during program execution, which is essential for debugging, monitoring, and auditing applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling ?\n",
    "ANS: The os module in Python provides a suite of functions to interact with the operating system, facilitating various file and directory operations.       While Python's built-in open() function is commonly used for file handling, the os module offers lower-level, OS-specific capabilities,                especially useful for advanced file system interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python ?\n",
    "ANS: Python's memory management, while robust, presents several challenges that developers should be aware of to optimize performance and avoid             potential issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python ?\n",
    "ANS: In Python, you can manually raise exceptions using the raise keyword. This is useful for signaling errors or exceptional conditions in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
    "ANS: Multithreading is crucial in certain applications because it enables concurrent execution of multiple tasks, leading to improved performance,          responsiveness, and resource utilization. \n",
